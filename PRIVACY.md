# Privacy

In general, the Safety Critical Rust Consortium adheres to the Rust Foundation's [privacy 
policy](https://rustfoundation.org/policy/privacy-policy/). 

That said, the Safety Critical Rust Consortium is an open organization and most everything the consortium does is reflected publicly in its GitHub repositories, including this one, and associated materials. If you proactively post personally identifiable information (PII) in an issue or pull request, that information will be public. 

Also, the consortium will occasionally run public surveys or polls that can be participated in by the public. Unless stated otherwise, these will generally be default anonymous, where we will not require any PII to participate. However, if you post PII in your responses, that information may be made public as we publish the raw results of the survey or poll.
