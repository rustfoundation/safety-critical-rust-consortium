# Website

This folder stores the `arewesafetycriticalyet.org` website that is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

Run this from the `arewesafetycriticalyet.org` directory.

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

> Note: You can also use `yarn` for the above as well.
