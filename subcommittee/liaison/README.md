# Liaison Subcommittee

## Subcommittee Mission Statement

The liaison subcommittee will both proactively and reactively collaborate with other subcommittees in the consortium and outside groups such as standards committees, the Rust Project. The committee will work to drive agreement on various, potentially similar, safety critical efforts pertaining to Rust. The committee will also be the point of contact for any potential legal issues that may arise around IP as it pertains to references, upstreaming content and more.

## Subcommittee Role

The role of the liaison subcommittee is liaising and collaboration, both within the consortium and, particularly, outside the consortium, with entities such as standards groups, the Rust Project, etc. 

- encourage or increase collaboration between different projects outside the Foundation
- provide common guidance on referencing, citing, transcluding and quoting other documents without treading on external IP
- identify opportunities to _upstream_ Rust into external projects and then to engage to make such work happen
