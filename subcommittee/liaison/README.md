# Liaison Subcommittee

## Subcommittee Role

A need for a liaison group was determined at the February 2025 meeting of the SCRC in London,
to try to help communication between the disparate and different groups working on different
things within the safety-critical space, both with and without Rust.

The goals of the group are to:

- encourage or increase collaboration between different projects outside the Foundation
- provide common guidance on referencing, citing, transcluding and quoting other documents without treading on external IP
- identify opportunities to _upstream_ Rust into external projects and then to engage to make such work happen

## Subcommittee Mission Statement

Provide a pathway for the SCRC to communicate effectively with independent projects not managed by the Foundation,
encouraging the adoption in other projects of work produced by the SCRC, and making it simple for the SCRC to
incorporate or reference work in other projects in a consistent way throughout its artifacts.
