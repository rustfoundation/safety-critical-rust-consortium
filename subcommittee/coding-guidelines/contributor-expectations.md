# Coding Guidelines Contributor Expectations

Welcome to the Coding Guidelines group. This document outlines a few things about the group to know the environment to expect. We do, intentionally, not define strong requirements for the group. This document helps you to self-identify if you are good fit. If you are in any way unsure, err on the side of joining.

You should be a member of the Coding Guidelines group if you want to write top of class coding guidelines that have strong generality.

This group is a knowledge-exchange, not a teaching space.

The group benefits most from:
* People with a sense of very high quality: Our work will be consumed over multiple industries. We are a force multiplier for all good and bad things.
* Knowledge of Rust: We only work on Rust here, so we need to assume a certain knowledge of it.
* Knowledge of critical spaces with high impact: whether it's safety-critical or software that just impacts a lot of people - experience in high correctness and how to reach it is useful.
* Bridge builders: You enjoy transferring the best practices between all industries.
* Self-Organisation: There's no project managers here. You feel empowered to drive things forward that you care for.

There's two general modes of contribution that are useful to put yourself in:
* Drafting and writing: you take over work items to work on in between meetings. You have knowledge you want to contribute.
* Observing: you mainly look at other people producing content, and give feedback and wisdom. Maybe you're the person that observers the corner everyone else has overlooked?

Its fine to switch between them given on your current constraints. It is useful to the people running the group to understand which mode you are currently in.

## Some fine print

The Coding Guideline groups is a Rust Foundation group and follows its policies, particular its [Code of Conduct](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).
