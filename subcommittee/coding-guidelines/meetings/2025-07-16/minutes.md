## **Meeting Minutes**

* Solicitation of notetaker  
* Acceptance of [Previous Meeting Minutes](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/meetings/2025-07-02/minutes.md)  
* Introduction of any new members  
* Review of [revised and rescoped milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1) focused on shaking out initial issues with coding guidelines process and philosophy \- 5 mins  
* Discussion \- 15 mins  
  * Discuss provenance and the `std::ptr` API (Felix, David), based on an informal discussion in the sync meeting yesterday after investigating INT36-C  
  * Two forms of provenance, strict and exposed, investigated based on the last three clauses of INT36 \- the new API should make it unnecessary to go through bare integer representations in order to apply things like masks with the strict provenance option; there is also the exposed option for when this is absolutely necessary i.e. for hardcoded hardware addresses  
  * Rust has the same concepts of alignment as C does; same concepts of ‚Äúpointing to an entity‚Äù as C does; trap representations are more specific to C  
  * Leads to a question: does this group care about \`unsafe\` as well as safe code? Should there be a distinction in the rules? Are we currently creating guidelines applicable to \`unsafe\`? Current consensus is that the group has not yet made this distinction  
  * The second paragraph raises some interesting questions about the permissiveness of the \`as\` operator and what can be converted to/from a pointer; exposes older assumptions that \`usize\` will always be the right size for pointers; want a Clippy lint for conversions between \_any\_ pointer and integer pairings \- \`usize\` is no longer guaranteed to be sufficient for this  
  * Third paragraph is less concerning for guidelines  
  * A lot of the knowledge about this is centralized into individuals \- an issue for many aspects of the language and its operational semantics  
  * Three tiers of support, documented in https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html  
  * tier 1 \= Intel & ARM (no embedded systems)  
  * Indicates a model of support for platforms; does not indicate what Rust aims to support.  
  * Do we want a rule "use only tier 1 platforms"?  
  * This would rule out lots of embedded platforms.  
* Working session \- 20 mins  
  * Read through [CERT C rules](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/2+Rules) together a bit  
  * Identify sections and folks that would like to translate these into the Rust coding guidelines  
    * [Rule 04\. Integers (INT)](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152052)  
    * [Rule 05\. Floating Point (FLP)](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152181)  
    * [Rule 03\. Expressions (EXP)](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152200)  
* Review session \- 10 mins  
  * Review open [PRs](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pulls) & [issues](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues)  
    * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/132](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/132) (do not divide by zero)  
      * The spec does not indicate what x / 0 actually does, but it seems to panic on some platforms.  
      * Been reviewed by Felix, please look offline & provide feedback.  
    * Request for action item to create issue about unsafe vs. safe tag on guidelines.  
* Round table \- 5 mins  
  * Seacord: For https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/137  
  * (Use matching types at the language boundary)  
    * Seacord: Interface using\_matching\_types at language boundaries. How concerned are we about portability? At CERT we limit "safe" labels to working on a particular platform. An interface that uses C short or char would never be portable?  
    * Alex: This might warrant a guideline  
    * Svoboda: yes. There is no C interface. Instead there is one interface to x86-64-Linux-GCC C, one to x86-32-Linux-Clang, and so on. Each has implementation-defined integer sizes, and most functions rely on them.  
    * Seacord: We could use several more code examples: one with static assertions, one with fixed-width C types.  
    * Alex: This is a rich area for mistakes.  
  * Douglas: FLS Speclock file is out of date.  I will update.
