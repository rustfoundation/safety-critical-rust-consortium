## Meeting Minutes

#### Acceptance of previous meeting minutes

* Douglas Deslauriers puts forward a motion to accept the previous minutes
* Accepted unanimously by the meeting participants

#### `unsafe` Docs Review Task Force \- progress report

*  The general tracking issue can be found here [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/123](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/123)
* The content for chapter “ABI and FFI” is tracked here [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/150](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/150)
* As well as a discussion surrounding the use of `unwrap` in a safety setting can be found here [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/145](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/145)

#### `unsafe` Practicum Chapter Task Force \- progress report

* Little progress made on this point due to other priorities

#### Progress report on booklet to define `unsafe` terms and scope

* Progress being made. “Ada safe coding guidelines” a good starting point to set the scope.
* Pull request in the works to set the outline bullet list. Plan to have it uploaded before next meeting.
* Important to highlight the distinction between what Rust considers unsafe (i.e. the `unsafe` keyword) and
  unsafe practices using safe Rust code (e.g. a deadlock or unconditional unwrapping).

#### Round table

* The MISRA guidelines for Rust are expected to be released soon but at the earliest at Embedded World 2025. This
  guideline will not be a list of Do’s and Don’ts for Rust code but rather a comparison with the C guidelines and
  if/how they are applicable to Rust.
* Important to understand the reason and context behind a certain (MISRA or other external-) guideline to better assess
  if the same issue still applies on the Rust side.
* The guidelines produced by this consortium will mostly likely be consumed by a wider group than those that have
  certification requirements. Examples are e.g. hyperscalers and others that have very similar safety/reliability
  requirements without needed certification. Therefore it is important that the guidelines are usable for the broadest
  possible audience without getting stuck in the minutiae of a certain safety standard.
* The guidelines produced should come with well defined rules (and properly highlighted in the text) and ideally an
  example of a coding pattern, tool etc that demonstrates how to adhere to the rule.
