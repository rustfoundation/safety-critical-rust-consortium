## Agenda

0. Solicitation of notetaker  
1. Acceptance of [Previous Meeting Minutes](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/meetings/2025-06-04/minutes.md)
2. Introduction of new members  
3. Review of [revised milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1) focused on shaking out initial issues with coding guidelines process and philosophy \- 5 mins  
4. Fleshing out Coding Guidelines portion of [arewesafetycriticalyet.org](http://arewesafetycriticalyet.org) (looking for a volunteer to work with the core team\!) \- 5 minutes
   1. Add deployment of coding guidelines to [coding-guidelines.arewesafetycriticalyet.org](http://coding-guidelines.arewesafetycriticalyet.org)
   2. Flesh in other contents, e.g. MISRA C Rust Addendum working with Tooling & Liaison
5. Working session \- 20 mins
   * Let's try to think of 1-2 guidelines ahead of time we'd like to jot down, macros are great, wider also fine  
   * Note\! We'd like to aim for unambiguous guidelines at this point to build confidence in their quality  
   * Spin off PRs to rough them in \- volunteers  
6. Review session - 20 mins
   * Review open [PRs](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pulls) & [issues](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues)
7. Round table \- 5 mins

## Coding Guidelines Thoughts

* Mine the Rustonomicon for `unsafe` coding guidelines  
  * May give rise to some `undecidable` guidelines due to some properties being unable to be verified statically  
* Mine The Little Book of Rust Macros for macro coding guidelines  
* \[todo\] Jordan writing a guideline for having a SAFETY comment above `unsafe` block and tie into the corresponding clippy lint  
  * Show the bidirectional linking  
  * [Undocumented unsafe block Clippy Lint](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html?groups=restriction#undocumented_unsafe_blocks)  
* \[todo\] MC/DC coverage limitations as a guideline  
  * By limiting to some subset it may be feasible to enable MCDC sooner / at all

## Housekeeping section

* Document space: [coding-guidelines](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines)  
* Zulip: [safety-critical-consortium: Coding Guidelines](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/445688-safety-critical-consortium/topic/Coding.20Guidelines)  
* [Early Alpha Milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1)  

## Tasks

* Search for the \[todo\] markers

## Meeting Minutes

* Acceptance of previous meeting minutes  
  * Highlights: [pull request with guidelines](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/127), demo on how to to propose a new coding guideline via [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/new?template=CODING-GUIDELINE.yml).  
* New member introduction.  
  * [Pull request with direct-recursion clippy lint](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/15006).  
* Review of [revised milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1): [todo] all, call for reviewing
  * Specificity for macros needed.  
  * Check if the workflow to contribute with guidelines is user-friendly enough.  
* [arewesafetycriticalyet.org](http://arewesafetycriticalyet.org)  
  * Deployment of coding guidelines to [coding-guidelines.arewesafetycriticalyet.org](http://coding-guidelines.arewesafetycriticalyet.org) already done\! [todo] PL, thank who took care of it üíå
  * Fill in resources.md at [docs coding\_guidelines](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/arewesafetycriticalyet.org/docs/coding_guidelines) \[todo\] by Jordan.  
* Working session  
  * Guidelines discussion  
    * Safety comments on unsafe blocks. Is any resistance to such a guideline expected?  
      * Similar guidelines in AUTOSAR (existance of Doxygen comments) and MISRA (document assembly, advisory) exist. It's probably not a CERT-style guideline, though. 
      * Existing clippy lint (cf. [Coding Guidelines Thoughts](#coding-guidelines-thoughts)).  
    * MCDC for rustc in the works. Interesting challenges with `match`. How to handle in the guideline wording; ‚Äúif using language feature X, then MCDC property Y cannot be achieved‚Äù.  
      * The wording sounds sensible. It could be a guideline.
      * Some material shared on the topic during the discussion:  
        [_Annotating Control-Flow Graphs for Formalized Test Coverage Criteria_ in arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04144v1) ([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675739))

Re: last meeting‚Äôs notes regarding stack frames and tail recursion

* [https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html\#large\_stack\_frames](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#large_stack_frames) lint for large stack frames  
* Explicit Tail Calls RFC work: [https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3407](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3407)   
  * It is intended for guaranteeing tail calls do happen (and the stack frame gets reutilized)
