## Tasks

## Meeting Minutes

#### Acceptance of previous meeting minutes

* Minutes from last meeting got accepted by the crowd

#### Intro for new members

* Robert Seacord introducing himself

#### Housekeeping (Time slot and frequency)

3 pm UTC was chosen so that it’s equally inconvenient for everyone ;)
There’s a Zulip poll for an alternative slot: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/445688-safety-critical-consortium/topic/Coding.20Guidelines/near/504615992
Meeting frequency: Should we increase frequency? Agenda’s always packed. [todo] Pete will open a topic on Zulip?
Might be an exception today
Weekly until RustWeek? Accepted by the crowd, [todo] Pete will increase frequency

#### MISRA C Addendum 6 (Rust) Brief

(Presenting the MISRA addendum PDF)
Published on 10th of March
Table with rules and their applicability to Rust (yes / no / partial) with comment
Estimate is that about 50% of the rules are not relevant
Thanks a bunch, good starting point
Can we copy the format / categories of the MISRA guidelines? There shouldn’t be a (™) on that, MISRA C 2020 is designed to be picked up, so copying the format should be fine
How do we make development efficient by helping devs by linking rule implementations with the MISRA standard?
Could be a topic for the liaison subcommittee.
MISRA is traditionally a bit more strict here, US laws should be “liberal enough”
Fair use should be a guideline, not directly copying entire rules, referencing chapters shouldn’t be a problem at all
Thanks to people involved in MISRA contribution, Rust Foundation can also give legal counsel here, liaison subcommittee should take over here

#### Safety Pamphlet Decoder Ring

(Presenting the pamphlet on the coding guidelines subcommittee repo)
First version has ben published under https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/initiatives/safety-pamphlet/decoding-safety-critical-code.md 
Define “unsafe” & “safety-critical”
Definition of “unsafe code”
Case study in avionics: There is no “unsafe” but “code that does/doesn’t follow sane & meaningful rules”. If the code follows the rules, it is considered good enough without further measuring its failure rate
Safety is always to be seen in context (example: timer)
Call for suggestions
What’s missing is a clear definition of unsafety in Rust, it’s also version dependent and as such is not defined sharply enough.
Agreement, this needs to be defined
The pamphlet might just say that this has to be defined on a project, it’s the obligation to do that if you use Rust in a safe field
This might be picked up and sharpened together with the rust project to streamline the definition of unsafe in the language

#### Ferrocene Language Specification

Let’s get in touch with the Rust project to ensure that things stay in sync. Let’s prepare upfront!

#### Review April 28th milestone

Milestones exist. Call for contributions to the milestones.
Q: How to start working on rules?
Generator script for rules exists, the README.md tells how to use the tool
Request: Demonstrate the process once?
PR exists that demonstrates this, maybe next meeting? (Good idea)

#### arewesafetycriticalyet.org

Suggestion to create a website “arewesafeyet.rs” / “arewesafetycriticalyet.org” (or something akin).
[info] Alex R. will help here. Call for content for such a website.
[todo] Action item for Pete to organize content gathering for the website

#### Review task force progress

(Showing guideline for writing a declarative macro, PR: https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/16)
There is a CI job generating html
Info: Live preview can be added to CI actions, open source solutions exist

#### Round table

Info: Assessors coming, let’s see what’s happening ^^
[todo] Call for reviews for https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/182 
Suggestion: Move of pamphlet to the coding guidelines repo?
