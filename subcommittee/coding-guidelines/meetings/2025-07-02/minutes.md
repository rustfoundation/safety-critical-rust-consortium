## Tasks

* Search for the \[todo\] markers

## Meeting Minutes

* [Rule 04\. Integers (INT)](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152052)
  * INT30-C, INT32-C, INT33-C are being handled in opened [PRs](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/136)
  * [INT35-C. Use correct integer precisions](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/INT35-C.+Use+correct+integer+precisions)
    * Noted as not relevant by Robert C. Seacord. Processors supported by Rust don't have to deal with padding bits.
* Prioritization of level of rules in CERT useful to customers that want ‚Äúmostly‚Äù correct code to begin with, i.e. where to spend resources and in which order
* \[todo\] **F√©lix Fischer** stepped in to lead this effort of [Early alpha coding guidelines published for a section of CERT C](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/6)
  * Take the integer section in CERT-C and map to 4.3.3.2 Integers, generate coding guidelines in the next few weeks.
  * Follow along with the style suggested by Alex Celeste in her [PR](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/127)
  * Coordinate efforts among others to have these PRs merged
  * Mapping from coding guidelines to the referenced material
    * Please ensure that [this issue](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/128) from Alex is also tackled to allow us to reference cited material
    * Build bibliography out of this reference option, e.g. take a look at [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) for some useful examples of metadata to include
    * Try to build the right metadata now and figure out how to visualize it later
