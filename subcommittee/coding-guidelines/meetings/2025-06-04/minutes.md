3. Review of [revised milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1) focused on broad \+ deep approach to macros chapter \- 5 mins  
4. Discuss work Alex Celeste has on-going for rewriting style guideline \- 20 mins  
5. Working session \- 20 mins

   * Spin off PRs to rough them in \- volunteers  
6. Review session:  
   * Review open [PRs](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pulls) & [issues](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues) \- 5 mins

## Coding Guidelines Thoughts {#coding-guidelines-thoughts}

* Do not divide by 0 (CERT INT33-C)  
  * \[todo\] by Douglas  
* Avoid lossy conversions (CERT INT31-C and FLP34-C)  
  * \[todo\] by Alex Celeste  
* Do not allow Injections (SQL, XSS, OS Command injection, etc.)  
  * \[todo\] by David  
* Do not dereference a raw pointer that is dangling or unaligned ([FLS](https://rust-lang.github.io/fls/expressions.html#fls_5cm4gkt55hjh))  
  * \[todo\] by   
* Do not allow recursion (advisory?) \- thereâ€™s a clippy lint that was suggested  
  * \[todo\] by Oreste  
* Static stack size analysis must be done  
  * Note that `emit-stack-sizes` is [nightly-only](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54192), not slated for stabilization  
  * Recursion is currently allowed, tail-call elision is not guaranteed  
  * Might *have* to be derived from static object-code analysis  
* Prefer macros which could be expanded and included as expanded source should safety-qualification needs dictate (advisory?)  
  * \[todo\] by Sasha

## Housekeeping section

* Document space: [coding-guidelines](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines)  
* Zulip: [safety-critical-consortium: Coding Guidelines](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/445688-safety-critical-consortium/topic/Coding.20Guidelines)  
* [Early Alpha Milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1)  

## Tasks

* See **above** for the \[todo\] markers

## Meeting Minutes

* Last weekâ€™s meeting minutes were accepted  
* Intro for the (absent) new members  
* Review of the [revised milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1) board, emphasis that dates are advisory only  
* Discussion on the ongoing style guideline rewrite  
  * Discussion of what goes into the guideline  
  * *Example* blanket requirement as per MISRA style  
  * Authors are asked to think about *who* the rule is going to target  
  * Appeal that more people will be *reading* the guideline rather than writing it  
  * Mandatory and Required guidelines are the priority  
  * Ask to read [PR \#27](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/127) and comment for everyone  
* Working session discussion  
  * See [Coding Guidelines Thoughts](#coding-guidelines-thoughts), above  
  * Discussion re procedural vs declarative macros: hygiene is much more complex and nuanced than may be first realized  
  * Macro hygiene is fundamentally a tooling problem  
  * Ask for volunteers to *test-run* the issue template on GitHub
