8. Emergent discussions:  
   * From checked arithmetic: rules about `unsafe` (part of the [overall guideline strategy w.r.t ‚Äúdefects‚Äù vs ‚Äúsubsets‚Äù](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/142))  
   * [From matching types at the language boundary](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/137)

   * From INT36-C adoption: New section for pointers and provenance (affects [ordering](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/157))  
9. Round table

## **Tasks**

* Search for the \[todo\] markers

## **Meeting Minutes**

* Approval of previous minutes.  
* No new people introduced.  
* Infrastructure topic, more than one pair of examples per guideline. Mention the other infrastructure topic.  
* CERT guidelines.  
  * Unless we overlooked, it appeared that guidelines corresponding to CERT  INT32-C and INT35-C hadn't been added.
  * Taking a look at [the issue inspired by INT34-C](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/156). Call for comments.  
    * It is asked if this is already covered by the checked arithmetic guideline. Encouraged to comment on the issue. A comment will be added \[todo\].  
  * Taking a look at [the issue about categorization](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/152). Call for comments. No comments.  
  * Taking a look at the checked arithmetic and division by zero pull requests. Discussion on the overlap, which comes from the CERT rules.  
  * [Discussing the issue about unchecked](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/148)   
    * Stemming from [the comment about unsafe](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/148#issuecomment-3089428786): subset-oriented approach and unsafe. Different approaches are possible based on how to deal with unsafe (blocks).  
      * Historical context about the use of unsafe added. 3rd party code in cybersecurity. Probably wanted to ban unsafe in that case. In functional safety, differently, "everything is under control". Then, there are interesting categories relating to drivers and what the actual definition of unsafe is; beyond the Rust definition? All in all, avoiding unsafe is desired, but banning it totally is going too far. It would rather be desired to push it to the bottom of the code. A follow-up comment: there will be rules (guidelines) which are only sensible to apply in the context of unsafe.  
    * It‚Äôs suggested to refrain from considering the unchecked operations in insolation \[important\].  
  * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/137](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/137)  
    * Recommendation to only use types without fixed bitwidths at the language boundaries. But, is it practical?  
  * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/158](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/158)  
    * [Similar in CERT C++](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88046339)  
  * Call for comments on a new section for pointers and provenance.  
    * It sounds good. It is suggested that provenance isn‚Äôt part of integers. It can be part of unsafe, noting that the unsafe section may become rather large.  
  * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/135](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/135)  
    * Looks like it is in a good state. Should it be moved to the new system? We start doing it during the meeting. Adding the label. The action is triggered and a [pull request](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/159) opened. It looks like a good start, although the code example may have not been copied over correctly \[todo\]  
  * Round table  
    * About panics, in addition to static analysis, since they‚Äôre in a way similar to unsafe, would it be feasible to use a way similar to what‚Äôs used for unsafe? In terms of documentation, justifying it the panicking state.   
      * An initial reaction is checked exceptions.  
      * Maybe there‚Äôs wording for it already in SAE.
