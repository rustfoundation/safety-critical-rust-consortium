## Meeting Minutes:

* **Logistics**  
  * Set up a Google Document space for the consortium  
    * We could also consider converting Google docs to markdown and putting them in GitHub too. Need to see if that makes sense  
* **Contributor Expectations**
  * Expectations  
    * Follow Rust Code of Conduct  
    * Participation mainly targeted towards senior engineers  
    * Folks should be actively contributing  
    * Understanding Rust and/or safety critical  
  * How are the guidelines enforced?  
  * (These are _not_ presented here due to decision to rework these in 2024-11-11 meeting)
* [**Mission Statement**](../../mission-statement.md)
  * Develop a community-vetted coding guideline for Rust in safety-critical applications  
  * Provide feedback offline  
* [**Unsafe coding guidelines proposal**](../../initiatives/safe-use-of-unsafe-guidelines/safe-use-of-unsafe-guidelines-proposal.md)
  * How does the `unsafe` keyword and usage fit into our coding guidelines?  
  * This will be the first item of output by the subcommittee  
  * Peter \- check and see what we can use out of JAE1020  
  * Jonas and Marc spoke and believe this is a good starting point.  
* **Time and meeting frequency**  
  * Proposal to meet once every two weeks  
    * General agreement that this is a good cadence to start with (Arthur spoke about this)  
  * Target duration will be one hour per meeting  
  * Have a few meetings at the current time and then potential shift to time after a re-vote on times.  
  * Need to see how we can make it accessible, at least once in a while, for folks in Asia.  
* **Management of upcoming topics**  
  * Spreadsheet of topics  
    * Maybe a GitHub Project spreadsheet?  
* **Round table**  
  * Other topics to be added on the upcoming topics list  
  * People with experience related to our goal to participate in some of our meetings
