## Meeting Minutes

1. Xander Cesari proposed the minutes of the last meeting be accepted and it was agreed unopposed.  
2. Reminder of the Hybrid consortium meeting occurring Wednesday next week.  
* PL suggested the group start work on a roadmap for the necessary items that should be addressed and how the work should be organised.  
  * DD suggested one start point would be with MISRA Rust work being formulated by Alex.  
  * OB suggested a marker to indicate that a particular feature is automatically checked. This comes from his work in the Tooling subcommittee.  A definition of undefined behaviour should be part of the glossary being produced by this subcommittee.  
  * DV cited the issue of deadlocks in rust not leading to undefined behaviour but can have safety implications in use.  
  * XC curious what blockers are from companies using rust in production. PL plugged software defined vehicle work group activity in response to this.  
  * JW discussed organisation practices with Rust development and mentioned the use of internal review whenever the unsafe keyword was required.  
  * JA1020 standard cited.  [JA1020 (WIP) Recommendations for the Rust Programming Language in Safety-Related Systems \- SAE International](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/ja1020/) should they be an inspiration?  
  * JP suggested use of tutorial development may be a useful way to help drive adoption once coding guidelines are done. Similar to Software Carpentry content. [Software Carpentry Lessons | Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)  
3. `unsafe` Formulate Chapter Material Task Force  
   * JW progress being made re intrinsics and highlighted some functions that need more attention [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/148](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/148)  
     * Transmute one example  
   * PL limited progress due to time constraints. Fernando made some progress on dangling and unaligned pointers.  [Example reading unaligned pointers. by iglesias · Pull Request \#154 · rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium · GitHub](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/154)  
4. `unsafe` Practicum Chapter Task Force  
* PL emphasised the need for work on the development on the Practicum. JP volunteered to assist.  
5. Safety Pamphlet \- progress report  
* Andrew Fernades unable to attend but he is still formulating what the safety pamphlet will look like.  
6. Round table  
   1. JW what is the agenda for next weeks meeting. [Add proposed agenda for February consortium meeting by JoelMarcey · Pull Request \#149 · rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium · GitHub](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/149)
