1. Solicitation of notetaker  
2. Acceptance of [Previous Meeting Minutes](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/meetings/2025-08-06/minutes.md)  
3. Introduction of new members
4. Review progress on guidelines incorporated from CERT  
   * [High-level mapping of CERT rule groups to Rust](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/152)
     * Integers - Félix
     * Arrays - Alex
     * Floating Point - Andrew (he will be unable to attend next few meetings; caught up offline and it's on his todo list)
5. Intrastructure - review [milestone](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1) ahead of launch to wider Rust community
   * [References per guideline, generate reference addendum](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/147)
     * Sam will begin work here; if anyone is interested in collaborating reach out
   * [Extract and test Compliant and Non-compliant code blocks](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/91)
     * Mehdi is getting this close, but worth discussing open items found during discussion [here](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/91#issuecomment-3166713858) and [here](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/pull/91#issuecomment-3172402940)
6. Development of FLS maintenance capabilities
   * Pete volunteered to champion this [t-spec goal](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h2/FLS-up-to-date-capabilities.html) because we rely on the FLS as an upstream dependency
   * Pete drafted this [FLS Team - North Star](https://hackmd.io/@plevasseur/HJb6qomOge/edit) document as a rallying point in the Consortium to gather interest
7. Discussion session
   * Pointers and provenance -- how to categorize?
8. Round table
