## **Meeting Minutes**

* Previous notes accepted
* List of issues we looked at:
  * https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/97
    Heads-up to author
  * https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/133
    Heads-up to the autor, added some questions
  * https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/137
    Heads-up to author, convert to PR?
  * https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/174
    Check already-existing comments and point out that the compiler should be able to catch that / tell the developer
    where it _could_ be a problem, at least for constants. Point out the human readability issue?
  * https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/156
    Looks very similar to #174. How to handle?
  * https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/185
    What about explicitly allowing smaller -> larger while not changing the signedness? There's already a clippy lint
    that warns you in case one's using "as" in non-safe scenarios, so why not allow that?

## **Material**

Any material to read before the meeting should be included here.

* Milestone: [Prepare for launch to wider Rust community](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/milestone/1)  
* [Github Issue to discuss about panicking in Safety Critical](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-coding-guidelines/issues/158)
