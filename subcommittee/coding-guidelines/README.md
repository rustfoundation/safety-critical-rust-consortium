# Coding Guidelines Subcommittee

Hi there üëã

We're happy to have your interest in coding guidelines for Rust deployed in safety-critical applications.

## Subcommittee Role

The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium got kickstarted at [RustConf24](https://rustconf.com/) where we identified a need for several subcommittees to help organize initiatives around safety-critical Rust.

Coding guidelines were a well-requested topic, so we formed this subcommittee.

## Subcommittee Mission Statement

A community-vetted coding guideline for Rust in safety-critical applications. A living document that is updated as features are added to Rust and we learn more by doing.

Please see further details in our [mission statement](mission-statement.md).

## Members and Membership

Please find the list of members [here](members.md).

The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium is still working through what this process is. Please check back soon.

## Meetings

We are still sorting out meeting scheduling and frequency. Please check back soon.

## Where to find us ‚úâÔ∏è
