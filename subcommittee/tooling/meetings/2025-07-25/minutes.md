  ## Meeting Minutes

* Approving last meeting‚Äôs minutes  
  
  * SC Tooling Issue template was approved and merged  
    * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/337](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/337)  
  * SC Tooling Request issue template is still open and in draft  
    * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/336](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/pull/336)  

* Following up on a discussion topic from last in-person meeting, we would like to look at the process of certifying software for a safety-critical standard and map out the tooling and standards required.  
  
  * Which standard to start with?  
    * ISO-26262  
    * DO-178C  
      * Likely a very difficult standard to start with and not the first standard to adopt  
    * We should pick the standard/industry where Rust is a first mover. Most likely automotive but if there‚Äôs an aero/space/defense standard that‚Äôs moving fast we should go there.  
  * Who can start on this?  
    * [Xander Cesari](mailto:xander.cesari@pictor.us) will be doing a similar project for some marketing efforts (running through a simulated cert process in Rust with some tooling) so about 60-80% of his work will likely overlap.  
    * In standard ISO-26262 processes they don‚Äôt point to specific tools, the standard is process-oriented and this often drives specific tools or manual processes. So there are many paths to certification.  
    * The process of certifying a tool itself for ISO-26262 is a further stretch goal, this should focus on the product focused process.  
    * Artifact output will be a page on the website and in the writing of this page identify any gaps in the process.  
    * Target ASIL D but highlight lower safety level requirements as well.  
    * Oreste has some templates and documentation that may be publicly shareable.  
    * Eclipse S-CORE may have some process documentation for using Rust in safety critical contexts. [tiago.manczak@infineon.com](mailto:tiago.manczak@infineon.com) to look for links and add them.  
    * [https://github.com/eclipse-score](https://github.com/eclipse-score) \- main github repo  
    * [https://eclipse-score.github.io/process\_description/main/process\_areas/tool\_management/index.html](https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/process_areas/tool_management/index.html) \- tool management process description  
    * [https://eclipse-score.github.io/process\_description/main/process\_areas/tool\_management/guidance/tool\_management\_checklist.html](https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/process_areas/tool_management/guidance/tool_management_checklist.html) \- checklist (suggestion: we could prepare such checklist for the SCORE project for the tools we are listing)  
    * Might be interesting to ‚Äúupstream‚Äù some of these blueprints/processes to orgs like SOAFEE or Eclipse SDV after we develop them internally. This could use the Eclipse Trustable Software Framework.  

* Who came with ideas for safety-critical tools to add to the database?  
  
  * Tools  
    * Pete  
      * TrustInSoft tool \- static analysis  
      * HighTec Compiler  
      * Kani  
    * Arnaud  
      * Ferrocene Compiler  
      * Mantra requirement tracing  
      * Verifast  
      * creusot  
    * Oreste  
      * OpenFastTrace \- requirements tracing  
      * Lautherbach debugger  
      * UDE Pls debugger  
      * Reqtify \- [https://www.3ds.com/products/catia/reqtify](https://www.3ds.com/products/catia/reqtify)  
    * Stephen  
      * Sphinx Needs \- requirements tracing  
      * AdaCore GNAT Pro for Rust  
      * Clippy  
    * Xander  
      * OxidOS RTOS \- OS / Libraries  
      * [Rapita](https://www.adacore.com/press/rapita-embraces-rust-via-adacore-partnership)  
      * OSS tooling  
        * Cargo extensions (deny, audit, etc)?  
  * Editor (Safety Evaluation as a part of the process is done. May not be included explicitly in DB, but could be highlighted as a step that need be done.)  
    * RustRover  
    * VSCode  
    * ?  
  * OS / libraries  
    * OxidOS RTOS  
  * Note that target audience for this website is existing safety-critical developers who know software and some SC processes but want to learn the state of the Rust ecosystem  
  * Task: submit Github issue using the Tool template adding these tools to the database  
    * [https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/new?template=submit\_tool.yml](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/issues/new?template=submit_tool.yml)  
  * Submitted an issue live to dogfood the process  

* MC/DC at Woven by Toyota  
  
  * The Woven by Toyota team working on MC/DC was an internship program and they won‚Äôt be able to finish it in time. So they‚Äôre switching over to a project that‚Äôs completable in the scope of their internship. Most likely their work won‚Äôt get merged but they have some interesting work done.  
  * There are still some interesting question marks in the Rust ecosystem about how Rust and MC/DC overlap.  
  * This may be an opportunity for the Consortium to highlight the Rust MC/DC gap and try to find someone to continue the work.
