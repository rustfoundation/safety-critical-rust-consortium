The first official meeting of the Safety Critical Rust Consortium occurred on 10 September in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, coinciding with the beginning of RustConf. 

Over 30 people attended, both in-person and virtually, from various companies and entities interested in ensuring that Rust can be used in safety critical applications. The meeting was a success with a mission being established, subcommittees being formed and excitement for future in-person meetings,

The next in-person meeting is tentatively scheduled for Rust Nation in early 2025.
