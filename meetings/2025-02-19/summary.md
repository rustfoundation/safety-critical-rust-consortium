  item, north star to be safe use of Rust, useful patterns for eliminating

  with external standards bodies and other organizations.
- **Tooling:** Discussed the development of mapping safety-critical requirements

  as the scope of the tooling working group in terms of build vs buy vs
  upstream.
- **Collaboration with the Project:** Discussed how to increase fruitful
  coordination with the Rust Project and how to decide when to upstream versus
  develop separately.
- **Funding & Reporting:** Explored using the Foundation for collective funding
  and potentially publishing a regular state of safety critical Rust report.
- **Evangelism:** Proposed creating a questionnaire for us to feed data into
  "Why Use Rust?" efforts.
- **Rust Spec Update:** Ferrous Systems has committed to contribute the FLS to
  the Rust Project with integration into the Rust spec initiative as a goal for
  this year.
- **Next Steps & Feedback:** Positive feedback on the unified consortium
