        The [Safety Critical Rust Consortium](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium) was [announced](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/announcing-the-safety-critical-rust-consortium/) in June 2024 with a goal to support the responsible use of Rust in Safety Critical software. The mission of the consortium is to improve the suitability of Rust in safety critical applications.
        
        Membership into the consortium is free and available to those with a noted and vested interested in the safety critical space. There are two types of membership:
        - Producer: An active participant in the consortium, helping drive its mission
        - Observers: A passive participant who wants to keep up with the consortium's happenings. Observers generally virtually attend meetings and listen in.
        
        This distinction is mainly for housekeeping purposes. You can choose which type of membership you plan to be initially and change it as needed.

        If you do become a member of the consortium, you will be added to the consortium mailing list, which is currently the only non-public asset of the consortium at this point.

        Also, don't forget to join the consortium's [Zulip channel](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/445688-safety-critical-consortium).

        > Note that the name, email address, and any company you provide will be public since GitHub issues are public. We do not use your information for any reason other than for membership purposes.
