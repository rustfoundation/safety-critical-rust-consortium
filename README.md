# SAFETY CRITICAL RUST CONSORTIUM

In June 2024, the Rust Foundation, AdaCore, Arm, Ferrous Systems, HighTec EDV-Systeme GmbH, Lynx Software Technologies, OxidOS, TECHFUND, TrustInSoft, Veecle, and Woven by Toyota jointly announced the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium. The primary objective of this group will be to support the responsible use of the Rust programming language in safety-critical software â€” systems whose failure can impact human life or cause severe environmental or property harm.

See the full announcement [here](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/announcing-the-safety-critical-rust-consortium/).
