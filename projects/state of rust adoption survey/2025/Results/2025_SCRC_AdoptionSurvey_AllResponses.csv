Rust just makes much more sense.","","","x","x","x","x","","x","x","x","","","x","x","","x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","x","x","x","x","x","x","x","","x","","1. Memory Separation
For safety critical systems, it is common to separate the ""safety critical"" memory from the ""non safety critical"" memory. Then the MPU is used together with the RTOS such that safety critical components are run in a ""priveleged"" mode such that it can access the safety critical memory, but other components that do not need to be developed according to ASIL-D level are run in a lower mode such that the MPU blocks it from accessing that memory. In order to help enable this, AUTOSAR has developed a standard way of specifying memory sections for variables of components. The linker file is then used to place the various sections into memory regions that the MPU will setup accordingly. I have not really looked into it, but I am not sure how trivial this would be in Rust.

2. Default of switch case
In safety critical  software, you **must** be 100% sure what your software will do, even if memory gets corrupted (i.e. you must be defensive). For this reason, MISRA specifies that a switch case shall always have a default case, even if you are switching on an enum and you covered all ""values"" of the enum.
In Rust, the ""match"" does not allow you to have a default. So I am unable to say if someone puts a bad value in for the value stored for the enum (or memory gets corrupted as it enters my function), I do not know which path my match would take.","","","","x","","","","","","x","","","","x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","x","","x","","","","","","","","","","","x","x","","","x","x","x","","x","x","","","We basically need a MISRA kind of ""authority"" to come and say, ""if you follow these guidelines, you're following best practice"". I believe MISRA has already made some strides towards a MISRA Rust guide but I believe nothing official yet.","1. Biggest hurdle: convincing management it is worth the cost of training. 98% of developers that I interact with (outside of our current c++ project) are c developers, and to train everyone in Rust is a really difficult sell (in terms of money and time).
2. Pressure from customers. We get paid by customers. They very often require either a c API, or they are just buying the entire solution (in which case they don't care about the language but more about the tools to configure the software). Since c already has established safety standards and guidelines that are meant to prevent most bugs, it is difficult to switch over unless a customer will pay us to do it."

- pushing the right tooling, ecosystems, SW Dev. env. and technology choices through team and projets
- supporting System eng. for safety-critical pack preparation, preparing req. specification accordingly and selecting processes & methodology according to the ECSS standards.
- supporting mission/operation SW life-cycle (i.e. ISS on-board SW deployment, cyber-security patching, update and network security)

I am a Rust ambassador, in touch with Ferrous System (Ferrocene) for bootstrapping the Rust approach in space SW...but still a long road to go I am afraid :/
